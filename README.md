# Splunk Synthetics Terraform Provider

This repository is a **beta** Terraform provider for [Splunk Synthetics in Splunk Observability](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/synthetics/intro-synthetics.html). It currently contains CRUD operations for API Checks, Real Browser Checks, Port Checks, HTTP Checks, and Variables.

**NOTE:** The client expects a valid Splunk Observability API token defined in the provider config (`apikey`) or as an environment variable named `OBSERVABILITY_API_TOKEN` (E.G. `export OBSERVABILITY_API_TOKEN="This_is_my_api_token"`)

### Rigor Classic (V1)
Rigor Classic endpoints and CRUD operations are still available by setting the provider's `product` setting to `rigor`
```
provider "synthetics" {
  product = "rigor"
}
```
**NOTE:** The Rigor Classic client expects a valid Rigor Monitoring API token defined in the provider config (`rigorkey`) or as an environment variable named `API_ACCESS_TOKEN` (E.G. `export API_ACCESS_TOKEN="This_is_my_api_token"`)

## Installation

Whenever possible install from the official Terraform Registry:  
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk/synthetics/latest

To install this provider locally follow the directions for installing [In-House Providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/install-software.html#in-house-providers).

## Examples

see ./examples/ for examples of Splunk Synthetics resources and datasources.
see ./examples/rigor/ for examples of Rigor Classic resources and datasources

## Import Existing Tests

Use `terraform import` as normally described in the [Terraform docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import/usage) to bring the resource into your state file. Using the check id number as the identifier.

### Example: Import browser check 496 to state file
```
terraform import synthetics_create_browser_check_v2.browser_v2_foo_check 496
```

To rebuild your configuration file more easily use the datasource for the check in question. This will pull the entire configuration of the check for rebuilding the configuration in your tf files and comparing against a `terraform plan` command.

## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.13.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.18
